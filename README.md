# Water-Pollution-dApp
A dApp that allows users to sell/buy pollutant permits in order to allow transparent and trustless emissions trading. This dApp was built using Truffle framework and a Ganache test network. The code was based off of Truffle Suites "Pet Shop dApp": https://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop.
